# Final-Assessment

## Self-Assessment 
I have actively participated in each stage of this project. I tried to take on more of a leadership role by guiding my team and keeping them on track. I suggested the topic, created the GitHub repository, added all the branches, created the jupyter notebook file and performed the initial analysis of the data, cleaned the data, trained the machine learning model and built the movie suggestion algorithm, kept the README file up to date, and created the final presentation. 
I also participated in many team discussions, offered help wherever possible, and did extensive research to provide accurate information and keep the project moving. 
The greatest challenge was assigning the roles and figuring out who is going to work on what without creating any discomfort. We had several people working on machine learning models, which didn’t stop us from achieving our goal and actually produced interesting & different results. We all learned from this and definitely came out feeling super achieved and proud of ourselves and each other. 

## Team Assessment 
As a team we communicated over Slack and Zoom, and really got to know each other very well. We had a little bit of a language barrier that really got us to learn to listen and ask questions to understand each other better. It was a challenge but it was also rewarding when things were clicking and we all felt on the same page. 
We tried our best to keep the communication open, discussing all possible ideas and suggestions, and asking for help where needed. 
Our greatest strength as a team was definitely our support for each other. We were straight forward to each other and really learned to play on each other’s strengths and skills. 

## Summary of the Project 
“Don’t Choose, Chill” - is a movie recommendation system that uses a natural language processing model to recommend movies based on a singular user input. 
The working principle is very simple: 
Our model looks at a movie you already like. If the movie is in our database, we trained our model to find similar movies and sort them based on their similarity distance to your input.
